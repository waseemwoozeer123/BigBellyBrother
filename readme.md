Big Belly Brother is a website to Leicester's local restaurants. It previews reviews from different users and including myself. The purpose of the website is help other users find a good place to eat that is Leicester Local.

Wireframe & Inspiration
I have attached a word documents to show case my wireframe and inspiration i gain from using the website Invision.
This helped me to maintain a clean level of consistency even with the colors.

Issues encounter
The first issue for me was to commit to github as I struggled to gather my commits. I had to remake a user and start commit again as they were failing. I was unable to identify the mistake I made at first.

The second issue for me was the ability to use the font as I did not know how to get the one I wanted however,  i used a <link> from Google fonts and got that font going.

I was trying to use the transform property to be able to mirror images without having to upload a mirrored version of the images. Specifically, I'm trying to use:

-moz-transform: scaleX(-1); -webkit-transform: scaleX(-1); -o-transform: scaleX(-1);

 However I left it in the end.
