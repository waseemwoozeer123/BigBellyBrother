                          <p>Fell in love with the place as soon as I walked in. I wanted something appropriate for breakfast and they had cookies, croissants or a smoothie bowl. Opted for the smoothie bowl apprehensively, expecting just a bowl of mushed fruits blended with ice. The presentation was too cute so eased off some of the apprehension. However, tucking into it there was a generous layer of granola which gave it a pleasant crunch! So top marks for that! The coffee was really good.. I'm a bit of a sweet tooth so let the host decide what was good and coffee was just as enjoyable. </p>

                          <p>I have been many times to Kobe since it has been open. Everytime the staff were friendly and welcoming. Service is always fast.
                            I have tried most of the burgers on the menu and they are truly an experience - in fact, I find it difficult to order burgers anywhere else as Kobe has set the standard to a very high bar! </p>

                      <p>TFirst time visited Grizzlers recommended by a friend at work. The burger was absolutely beautiful, I ordered the juicy lucy (Highly Recommended) I also had cheesy chips, which looked amazing but made me a bit sickly after finishing the whole person, never the less I would certainly go back again.
                        The only one small issue I had was I had to constantly ask for some extra dips and waiter sounded a bit rude in his response. And for that reason I haven't given a 5 star rating as that's an import aspect for me when ordering food.</p>
